License Explanation:

Hardware:
This license means that you can have these designs produced by the PCB maker of your choice, for your own personal use.
You, the licensee, are not permitted to re-sell the PCBs which are produced using these design and production files.  They are not licensed for sale of any kind, regardless of whether you have 'spares' left over.  Selling them 'at cost' or 'below cost' is also a violation of the license, because those are sales too.

3D Printable Files:
This license allows you to print these printable files yourself, or have them printed for you, for your own personal use.  You, the licensee, are not permitted to re-sell the printed parts which are produced under this license.  They are not licensed for sale of any kind, regardless of whether you made (or had made) more than you needed.  A sale 'at cost' or 'below cost' is still a sale and is a license violation.

All other files:
Seriously, why would you try to sell these?

Alternate Licensing available:
If you would like to produce these hardware designs and printed parts for sale, you are encouraged to contact Tech by Androda, LLC to arrange alternate licensing.  https://androda.work/about/
