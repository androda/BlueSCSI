Parts List for F4 SMD V1.1

Through-hole parts:
Some 2.54mm header strip (optional, could hard wire 'USE_TPWR' jumper and hard wire the LED)
A 2.54mm jumper (If using header strip for the USE_TPWR jumper, this is required)
Berg Floppy connector, TE Connectivity 171826-4
50 pin SCSI connector, male 2x25 2.54mm header - can be straight-out or right-angle as long as the notch is in the right place.
^ For the SCSI connector, there are a ton of options:
* 3M 30350-6002HB (straight)
* 3M 30350-5002HB (right angle)
