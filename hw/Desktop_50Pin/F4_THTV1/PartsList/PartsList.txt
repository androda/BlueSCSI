Parts List for F4 THT V1

Through-hole parts:

Some 2.54mm header strip (optional, could hard wire 'USE_TPWR' jumper and hard wire the LED)
A 2.54mm jumper (If using header strip for the USE_TPWR jumper, this is required)
0ZRR0050FF1E fuse, x1
SB130-T diodes, x2 (any schottky with 800mA+ rating ought to be fine)
LD1117V adjustable linear regulator x1
MFS1/4DCT52R1200F 120 ohm resistor for position R2, x1
MFR-25FBF52-154R 154 ohm resistor for position R1, x1
^  These resistor *values* are non-negotiable, but their physical sizing can differ
470 Ohm resistor for LED, x1  (bought on eBay, precision and rating don't matter)
4610X-101-111LF 110 ohm resistor network, x2
^ Can grab some 20 pin DIP chip sockets and chop in half to use as sockets for the resistor nets
Berg Floppy connector, TE Connectivity 171826-4
50 pin SCSI connector, male 2x25 2.54mm header - can be straight-out or right-angle as long as the notch is in the right place.
^ For the SCSI connector, there are a ton of options:
* 3M 30350-6002HB (straight)
* 3M 30350-5002HB (right angle)

Microcontroller Module:
STM32F411 "Black Pill" (note that there are two versions of this design, one using an F411 and one with an F401 - F411 is the correct one)
This is the one you want: https://stm32-base.org/boards/STM32F401CEU6-WeAct-Black-Pill-V3.0
^ Note that this page says it's an F401, but the official store (aliexpress link below) shows an F411.
* Search Amazon or eBay for "STM32F411"

Surface-Mount parts:
Four 1206 size 22uF capacitors, 10+ volt rating (higher voltage rating is better, I used 25V)
Molex 105162-0001 MicroSD Card Slot
