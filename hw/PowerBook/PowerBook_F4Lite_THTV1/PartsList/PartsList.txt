Parts List for PowerBook F4Lite THT V1

Through-hole parts:

0ZRR0050FF1E fuse, x1
SB130-T diodes, x3 (any schottky with 800mA+ rating ought to be fine)
LD1117V adjustable linear regulator x1
MFS1/4DCT52R1200F 120 ohm resistor for position R2, x1
MFR-25FBF52-154R 154 ohm resistor for position R1, x1
^  These resistor *values* are non-negotiable, but their physical sizing can differ
4610X-101-102LF 1000 ohm resistor network, x2
^ Can grab some 20 pin DIP chip sockets and chop in half to use as sockets for the resistor nets
40 Pin PowerBook SCSI connector
* Harwin M22-2042005
* 2x20 2.0mm two-row connectors have been hard to find.  But 2x40 are somewhat common, and can be cut in half with an exacto knife.
